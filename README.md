# VotingDapp

This is a dapp that allows users to create elections and vote in them too. I followed two tutorials from Dapp University. The [first tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzvk2kdjr2I&t=1943s) was for creating a to-do list dapp. The [second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqnKNy7br4I) shows how to deploy a smart contract to a test network and the mainnet. This [website](https://medium.com/@ethdapp/deploy-smart-contracts-to-the-ethereum-mainnet-with-truffle-ebf0bf9a9efe) also shows how to deploy a smart contract. Futhermore, I used templates from the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/). In addition, I visited this [website](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/set-up-web3js-to-use-ethereum-in-javascript/) to see how to use web3.js, and visited this [website](https://blockchain.oodles.io/dev-blog/interacting-with-ethereum-smart-contracts-through-web3js-library/) to see how to interact with a smart contract. I used the info and code from these resources to create my own voting dapp.
